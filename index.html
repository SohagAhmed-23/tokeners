                            Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to
                            thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one
                            problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing
                            the
                            moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
                            cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far
                            down?
                            So down that even a celebrity can explain it in
                            simple
                            words to their followers and have them download an
                            app,
                            buy into the social currency of their favourite
                            person
                            and watch their investment as is with other
                            cryptocurrency project.

                            We are trying to do to this space what investment
                            apps
                            did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are
                            gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular
                            faces
                            instead of hard to understand projects to make it
                            the
                            norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for
                            a
                            lot of people to finally give this space a real
                            look.

                            and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that

                            There would be new markets and advertisers with

                            to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye said,
                            "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of them".
                            Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds
                            like
                            something we hope he would say.

                            Currency is digital, it has been that way for a
                            while
                            now, but this time there would be no dead presidents
                            on
                            the money, there would people like you on the money,
                            and
                            you would own it because it would make the most
                            sense in
                            the world.
